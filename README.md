Numerical model and simulation of a truck with a fluid basin


The model is based on the following paper:  
[Numerical optimal control of a coupled ODE-PDE model of a truck with a fluid basin](https://www.aimsciences.org/article/doi/10.3934/proc.2015.0515)


This is still an ongoing work. The goal is similar to the paper mentioned above. However, we will deploy different optimization methods.  


The animation below shows the moving truck due to an external forces of 4000N for 0.5 seconds. After that, the force is removed. See the file: [demo1.m](https://github.com/auralius/truck-with-fluid-basin/blob/main/demo1.m). Since there is no friction between the truck and its environment, the truck keeps moving.
